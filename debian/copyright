Comment:
  Source for Snoopy 1.3 was originally downloaded from
  http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/marius/snoopy/ but has since been removed
  from that location.  The canonical source location is now on SourceForge
  (http://sourceforge.net/projects/snoopylogger/), and the 1.3 tar.gz file
  there has an md5sum that differs from the original 1.3 tar.gz file, but
  the contents were verified as identical via diff -urN on 2004-05-24.
  .
  Source for the versions tagged 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.6.0, 1.6.1 were taken
  from the tarballs at SourceForge.
  .
  All remaining source is taken from the GitHub Git repository listed
  in the Source field above.
