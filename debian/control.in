Description: An execve() wrapper and logger
 snoopy is merely a shared library that is used as a wrapper
 to the execve() function provided by libc as to log every call
 to syslog (authpriv).  system administrators may find snoopy
 useful in tasks such as light/heavy system monitoring, tracking other
 administrator's actions as well as getting a good 'feel' of
 what's going on in the system (for example apache running cgi
 scripts).
